# VulkanRenderer
A Vulkan Renderer by Sam Boots used to experiment with Vulkan and GraphicPipelines in general.

To actually use this renderer you need the Vulkan, GLM and GLFW library to work with this. To get these Libraries just use this link:

Put all the Individual Libraries inside the ExternalLibraries directory.

Later down the road imGUI will also be used, because of that it is also included in the ExternalLibraries zip.
